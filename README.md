# Headless Blog App

 





A modern, content-first blog application built with **React**, **GraphQL**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project is designed to give developers and designers full control over the front-end while integrating seamlessly with any headless CMS.

By separating content management from presentation, this blog offers a **high-performance**, **scalable**, and **customizable** platform ideal for personal blogs, portfolios, or content-heavy sites.

## Why Headless?

Traditional CMS platforms handle both content and presentation, which can limit flexibility and performance. A headless approach decouples the front end from the back end, allowing you to:

- Choose your preferred CMS (e.g., Sanity, Strapi, Contentful)
- Fetch structured content via GraphQL APIs
- Build blazing-fast front ends with modern frameworks like Next.js
- Design freely using utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS

### 1. Choose a CMS

Some popular options include:

- **[Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)**
- **[Strapi](https://strapi.io/)**
- **[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)**
- **[GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/)**

### 2. Set Up Your Content Model

Define your content types (e.g., Post, Author, Category) inside your CMS. Be sure to include:

- **Title**

### 3. Connect via GraphQL

Use your CMS’s GraphQL endpoint in the `.env.local` file:
